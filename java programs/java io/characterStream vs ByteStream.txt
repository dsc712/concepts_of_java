When to use Character Stream over Byte Stream? 

In Java, characters are stored using Unicode conventions. Character stream is
useful when we want to process text files. These text files can be processed
character by character. A character size is typically 16 bits.


When to use Byte Stream over  Character Stream? 

Byte oriented reads byte by byte.  A byte stream is suitable for processing raw data like binary files.


Notes:

Names of character streams typically end with Reader/Writer and names of byte streams end
with InputStream/OutputStream
